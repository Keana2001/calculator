This Python script is a multipurpose utility toolkit that offers users two key features in one place: a basic calculator for performing arithmetic operations, and a trip cost estimator for calculating travel expenses.

The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with user-friendly input and error handling. The trip cost estimator prompts the user for airfare, hotel stay details, and car rental costs, then calculates the total trip expense including applicable taxes.

Users are guided by a menu to select the tool they want to use, and can return to the main menu or exit at any time. This program is ideal for beginners learning how to structure Python programs with functions, loops, and input validation.
